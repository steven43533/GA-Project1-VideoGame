## Project Ideas:
##### Slither.io game, you start with a small snake, there's food on the map, use WASD to move the snake, you can't move backwards tho(collapse into yourself) and you lose if you "eat" yourself. 

##### Game includes: 
###### A snake, a board with borders, a textbox showing length(one food ate -> length++), some sort of implementation of AI to meet requirement.(ex: food moves around, enemy snakes that take away length if they touch you), start button, results box after game is over, reset game button), announcer box.

##### Things for later:
###### Choose color of your snake from a few options, decrease the speed of snakes movement based on length(longer length=slower, vice versa)

## MVP goals: 
##### Start screen, snake moves, snake length increases with each food ate, food spawns at a new location if previous is ate, boundaries are set to snake can't go off screen.
