# Video Game Project 1(snake knockoff)

## Techstack:
* HTML/CSS/JS
## Wireframe link: 
* https://wireframe.cc/Qrrq3P

## Project Ideas:
##### Slither.io game, you start with a small snake, there's food on the map, use WASD to move the snake, you can't move backwards tho(collapse into yourself) and you lose if you "eat" yourself. 

##### Game includes: 
* A snake, a board with borders, a textbox showing length(one food ate -> length++), start button, results box after game is over, reset game button), announcer box.


## MVP goals: 
* Start screen 
* snake moves 
* snake length increases with each food ate
* food spawns at a new location if previous is ate
* boundaries are set to snake can't go off screen
* if snake runs into itself it dies. 


## Stretched goals: 
* Choose color of your snake from a few options
* decrease the speed of snakes movement based on length(longer length=slower, vice versa)
